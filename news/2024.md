 In this program, we will feature outstanding papers presented at top-tier conferences in the field of computer vision, such as CVPR 2024, ICCV 2023, and NeurIPS 2023, through oral and poster presentations.
 Additionally, we have prepared a variety of valuable programs, including keynote lectures by renowned international scholars, discussion sessions to share thoughts on the future of computer vision with domestic researchers, a Doctoral Colloquium, and demo sessions.
 This year, the keynote lectures will be delivered in person by three distinguished researchers in the field of vision: Ivan Laptev (Inria/MBZUAI), Stella X. Yu (University of Michigan), and Yong Jae Lee (UW-Madison), who will provide engaging lectures and discussions.

 Furthermore, the online program will include workshops on research methodologies by leading researchers and tutorials where participants can practice programming the latest papers presented at KCCV 2024 in a virtual setting.
