Before joining the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Pusan National University, Professor Sangryul Jeon obtained his Ph.D. from Yonsei University, where he researched machine autonomy based on image matching. During his doctorate, he worked as a Research Intern at Adobe Research, San Jose, focusing on correspondence-driven style transfer. From 2022, he served as a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley's EECS department and later as a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

He has published ten papers (four as the first author) in top-tier computer vision conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS, continuing his research on self-supervised representation learning and image matching-based generative algorithms.

### my history

I was a postdoctoral scholar in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of Michigan and an affiliated researcher at UC Berkeley/ICSI advised by Prof. Stella X. Yu.

I obtained my B.S., and Ph.D. degrees advised by Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn in School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University in 2016 and 2022, respectively. I was a research intern with researchers Zhifei Zhang and Zhe Lin in Creative Intelligence Lab of Adobe Research from June 2021 to November 2021.

My current research centers on analyzing local environments of an object or scene of interest without the need of supervision but driven by visual correspondences.
