I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of Michigan and an affiliated researcher at UC Berkeley/ICSI advised by Prof. Stella X. Yu.

I obtained my B.S., and Ph.D. degrees advised by Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn in School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University in 2016 and 2022, respectively. I was a research intern with researchers Zhifei Zhang and Zhe Lin in Creative Intelligence Lab of Adobe Research from June 2021 to November 2021.

My current research centers on analyzing local environments of an object or scene of interest without the need of supervision but driven by visual correspondences.
