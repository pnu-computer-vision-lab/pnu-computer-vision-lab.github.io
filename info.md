Good to Have Skills
- Experience in machine/deep learning tools (e.g., Scikit-Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch) is a plus.
- Backgrounds in real analysis, convex optimization is a plus.

Research
- Professor Sangryul Jeon obtained his Ph.D. from Yonsei University, where he researched machine autonomy based on image matching. During his doctorate, he worked as a Research Intern at Adobe Research, San Jose, focusing on correspondence-driven style transfer. From 2022, he served as a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley's EECS department and later as a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
- Professor Sangryul Jeon has published ten papers (four as the first author) in top-tier computer vision conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS, continuing his research on self-supervised representation learning and image matching-based generative algorithms.
